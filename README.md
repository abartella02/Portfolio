### Welcome to my programming Porfolio!

## Projects:
**Auto Sublist Maker:** A project I worked on during my time as a project coordinator at a construction company

  - Taking in a list of desired subcontractors from a word document, it searches the company's excel sheet for the subcontractor's contact information
  - Once acquired, it sorts the information by subtrade then inserts it into a macro-enabled excel document, which I programmed using VBA
  - The time required to manually fill this excel document was incredibly long, which inspired me to create this application in order to speed up the process

**InsiderBot:** A personal project that I created when I began trading in the stock market

  - Uses Discord for input and output
  - Reports information on a specified stock (50 day average, daily high, daily low, yield, etc)
  - Provides insider trades information: CEOs/company heads/politicians that bought or sold large amounts of company stock
  - Uses requests and beautifulsoup python libraries to scrape the web for the above information, as well as the discord library

Notes: Unfortunately, I'm unable to share my current C/C++ and ARM UAL projects, since they were for academic purposes and I would get flagged for academic dishonesty by the school
